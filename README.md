# sawUDPPSM #***sawUDPPSM*** is a saw component, and it is a legacy version. It was created to support master/slave Teleoperation where one side is not dvrk but rather via UDP communication. This was first used in the Teleoperation between dVRK MTM as master robot and IREP as slave robot (IREP - Insertable Robotic Effector Platform, developed at ARMA lab). Laster, ***mtsUDPMaster*** was created such that a PSM hardware can be commanded using UDP (especially for the ease of Simulink Real-time environment, e.g. [slrt-dVRK-commander](https://github.com/vu-arma-dev/slrt-dVRK-commander)) for trajectory planner purpose.Since 2016, this legacy version has been replaced with a more complete protocol and module (e.g. mtsSocketBasePSM) that can be found under [***sawIntuitiveResearchKit***](https://github.com/wanglong06/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/tree/master/components/code).
